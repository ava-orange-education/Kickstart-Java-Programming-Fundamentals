In Java's realm, 
code comes alive, 
logic and structure help ideas thrive. 

Classes and methods, 
clear and neat, 
turn problems solved into a coding feat.

Bug fixes bring a joyful cheer, 
in Java's hands, 
there's nothing to fear. 

Programs that run, 
and code that's clean, 
with Java, the joy of programming is seen.
