Java the Corgi, swift and bright,A tri-color marvel, such delight.With ears that perk and eyes that gleam,She dances through life like a dream.In meadows green and fields so wide,Java bounds with joy, full of pride.Her fluffy coat a banner high,A flash of color as she dashes by.Beneath the sun, under skies so blue,Java's spirit shines right through.With every leap and every bark,She leaves a trail, a joyful spark.Java, the Corgi, small but bold,Her heart of gold, a story told.In every wag and playful prance,Java lives life like a dance.
